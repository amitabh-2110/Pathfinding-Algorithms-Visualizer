# Pathfinding Visualizer

The Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool that helps in visualizing 
different algorithms working behind the scene to the find shortest
path between two nodes. You can also create walls, change the 
coordinates of the starting node and ending nodes and play around 
with this visualization tool.

## Algorithms Implemented 

The application supports the following algorithms.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - It is weighted single source shortest path algorithm in which the graph should have positively weighted edges. It guarantees the shortest path.

- **A Star Search Algorithm** - It is arguably the best pathfinding algorithm which uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.
